              (DFT), to display regularities with respect to scales that divide
              the octave into equal parts. Concretely, the wavescapes from 1 to
              6 correspond to specific divisions of the octave: into 12
              semitones, 6 tritones, 4 augmented triads, 3 diminished-seventh
              chords, 12 diatonic/pentatonic scales, and two whole-tone scales.
              If a part of a piece predominantly uses pitches from such a
              collection, the corresponding areas in the wavescapes will be
              relatively homogeneous in color. For example, if the notes of the
              B diminished triad <code>BÂ° = (11, 2, 5, 8)</code> are used
              recurrently then this is shown in green in the fourth wavescape.

              Back to the <i>Phantom</i> example: there are a number of
              interesting observations about the tonality of this piece that we
              can draw from the wavescapes.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              <b>Wavescapes 3 and 5</b> have the strongest colors, meaning that
              diating scales as well as augmented triads play and important role
              for the harmonic organization of the piece.

              <b>On the lower levels of the 3rd wavescape,</b> the colors blue -
              green - yellow - pink ( - green - ) pink change in regular time
              intervals. Tracing this sequence of colors in the corresponding

              , and <Tex math='H_{0, 1}' />, respectively (in clockwise
              direction). A label <Tex math='H_{i,j}' /> denotes the hexatonic

              ). The overall harmonic trajectory of this piece moves in

              different keys. Note that the red and pink areas are adjacent to
              each other but opposite to the green area, again showing a
              symmetrical organization in terms of keys.

            <Paragraph>
              <b>Finally, the 6th wavescape</b> shows that the first half of the

            <Paragraph>
              Very short window lengths tend to distribute the segments of the
              piece more evenly throughout the circles. In contrast, long window
              lengths collapse the semgents into a small area, and even into a
              single point if the window covers the entire piece (this
              corresponds to the topmost point of the wavescapes). It is
              therefore a good idea to try different window lengths in order to
              identify an appropriate level of detail, in which the piece moves
              along rather smooth paths in at least some coefficients. The gif
              below shows the effect of increasing the window size.

              Changing the parameters time resolution and window length yield
              different analytical perspectives on the piece and allow for a
              scalable and dynamic reading of a piece.

              <b>Note:</b> the wavescapes do not change because re-rendering
              them could last very long if the piece is long and the

              Apart from uploading a musical piece as a MIDI file, the app also
              allows you to enter your favorite pitch-class sets. This can be
              useful if you want to show, for instance, certain chord
              progressions, harmonic sequences, or voice-leading chains. It can
              also be useful to display interesting pitch-class sets taken from
              a particular piece. Those can be entered in the{' '}
              <b>Custom pitch-class vectors</b> field and allow for two basic
              input formats.

                  <code>&#123;</code> and <code>&#125;</code> and contain pitch
                  classes (integers ranging from 0 to 11). We allow for multiple
                  occurrences of pitch classes, for example you can enter{' '}
                  <code>(0, 0, 4, 7, 10)</code> for a C dominant-seventh chord
                  with doubled C.

                  comma-separated non-negative numbers. Internally, these
                  vectors are normalized to sum to one, so only the relative
                  weights are taken into account. For the C dominant-seventh
                  chord from above one would enter

              The collection of manually entered pitch-class vectors is
              displayed below the input field. Entries in this collection can be
              toggled by clicking on them, or deleted by clicking on the x. When
              loading the app, three pitch-class vectors are already in the
              collection, and the first of them is active. They need to be
              deactivated or deleted if you don't want them to be displayed.

              This chord can be understood as a C7/9/11 chord despite the fact
              that the key signature indicates B major / G <span>&#9839;</span>{' '}
              minor. Being a dominant, it strongly points to the F-major
              prototype (marked by <span>&#9837;</span> ) in the fifth
              coefficient. Connoisseurs of Scriabin's harmonic language will
              recognize this chord as the tritone substitution of the extended
